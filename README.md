# Google Search Console - SEO Cannibalization Analysis Script

This Python script analyzes data from Google Search Console and provides insights into potential opportunities for page-level consolidation based on click and impression metrics.

## Prerequisites

Before running this script, please ensure you have the following:

1. **Python Dependencies**: You must install the required Python dependencies on your system. You can install them using pip:
- `pip install pandas numpy`

2. **Google Search Console Data**: You should have a CSV file named `dataset.csv` that contains the data exported from Google Search Console. The CSV file should have the following columns:

- `page`: The URL of the page.
- `query`: The search query.
- `clicks`: The number of clicks for the page-query combination.
- `impressions`: The number of impressions for the page-query combination.
- `position`: The average position of the page-query combination.

**Note:** You can use this tool to extract this data from the API (https://www.seoworkflows.com/tools/extraction/google-search-console-api). I'd recommend getting the past 3 to 6mo of data.

3. **Update 'CONFIG'**: You must update the "FILE_LOCATION" and "BRAND_VARIANTS" at the top of the `main.py` file

## Running the Script

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Navigate to the directory where the script (`main.py`) is located.

3. Place your `dataset.csv` file with the required columns in a new `data` directory.

4. Open a terminal or command prompt and run the script using the following command:

- `python main.py`

5. The script will generate an Excel file (`output.xlsx`) with analysis results.

## Output

The script will create an Excel file with multiple tabs for different analysis stages:

- `cannibalization_opps`: Contains the final analysis output.
- `immediate_opps`: Lists queries with 2+ pages marked as 'Potential Opportunity.'
- `risk_qa_data`: Includes query-level data for pages in 'cannibalization_opps.'

## Interpretation

- Queries marked as 'Potential Opportunity' are considered for consolidation.
- Queries marked as 'Risk' suggest caution, as they may risk more valuable queries during consolidation.

Please review the Excel file generated by the script for consolidation opportunities and further instructions.

**Note:** This README assumes that you have already obtained the necessary data from Google Search Console and that it is stored in the required format in the `dataset.csv` file.
